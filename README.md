## Project Title

Stylized Shaders

## Collaborators

Oscar Dadfar (odadfar), Olivia Loh (pending), Maxton Huff (pending)

## Summary

We are going to write video shaders that simulate a lot of the stylized generative effects found in SpiderVerse and simmilar NPR media. We will start by trying to create the effects that effectively paramaeterize them, finding a balance between user control and usability without being too difficult. We will then shift gears to focus on performance, with the overall goal being a set of After Effects video filters that can be used by actual artists.

## Inputs & Outputs

We will constrin this problem to video only, meaning we want to be able to achieve normally 3D NPR effects on 2D video. Our input will be a video source and a few parameters yet to be determined, such as intensity of certain effects, color, etc. The output will also be a video, but with the filter applied.
